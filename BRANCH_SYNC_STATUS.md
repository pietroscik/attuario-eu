# Branch Synchronization Status

- `work` branch checked out and used as source of truth for alignment.
- Local `main` branch updated to point at the same commit as `work`.
- Push to `origin/main` attempted but failed because the remote `origin` is not configured in this environment.
- Pipeline and deployment verification could not be completed without access to the remote repository or deployed environment.

Please configure the `origin` remote (e.g., `git remote add origin <url>`) and rerun the push command, then verify pipelines/deployments using the appropriate services.
